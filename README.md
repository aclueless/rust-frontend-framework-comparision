Comparision for different frontend frameworks (for Rust-lang) using
different features.

The implementations can use different framework features. But things
that are not framework-related should be the same. For example, all
implementations should use the same type for item's id. For the first
implementations, I use u32 for todo's item in TodoMVC app.

Currently there are only implementations of Spair, Yew for TodoMVC app.
