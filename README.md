Comparision for different frontend frameworks (for Rust-lang) using
different features.

The implementations can use different framework features. But things
that are not framework-related should be the same. Such as, all
implementations should use the same type for item's id, or use the
same third party crates.

Currently there are only implementations of Spair, Yew for TodoMVC app.
